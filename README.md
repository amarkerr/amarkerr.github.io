Hi, Iâ€™m Amanda Kerr! I'm a Computer Science major specializing in software engineering, and I'm interested in creating tools that promote accessibility and inclusive design. For my final project at SNHU, I improved a calendar application I had developed earlier in the program to align it more closely with industry standards and contemporary architecture.

<summary>Reflecting on the CS program and capstone</summary>
<br/>
During the Computer Science program, I acquired both technical skills and a professional mindset essential for success in software development. Creating this ePortfolio allowed me to reflect on my journey, evolving from writing simple components to developing scalable, cloud-based applications that adhere to modern architectural patterns. This process also enabled me to critically evaluate my long-term aspirations: to create intuitive, inclusive, and well-designed software.
<br/>
<br/>
  
I acquired many of my skills through hands-on coursework, applying fundamental concepts to real-world scenarios. I gained significant experience in collaborative settings, especially during team projects that utilized version control, shared responsibilities, and peer code reviews. In these situations, I became proficient in using Git, effectively communicating changes, and contributing to a shared codebase. A notable instance was during the elective course, <a href="https://github.com/amarkerr/GAM305-BlueTeam">GAM-305</a>, where I guided a small team of developers in creating a short platformer video game. Besides leading the team, I dedicated much of my time to teaching them how to use Git and GitHub effectively and helping resolve several merge conflicts.
<br/>
<br/>

Effective communication has also been a consistent focus in my coursework. From documenting code and creating walkthrough videos to participating in class discussions, I have sharpened my ability to convey technical decisions clearly to diverse audiences. For instance, the code review video featured in this portfolio pushed me to present my work in a concise and accessible way, deepening my understanding and ability to explain the rationale behind my design choices. Additionally, collaborating with classmates on Discord has allowed me to forge connections and offer tutoring support to my peers.
<br/>
<br/>

From a technical standpoint, I've enhanced my understanding of data structures and algorithms through projects that emphasized performance considerations. For instance, my work in <a href="https://github.com/amarkerr/CS300-BinaryTree">CS-300</a> necessitated a clear grasp of various data structures to identify the most suitable one for a small project, which I then built. Additionally, my knowledge in software engineering and database management has grown considerably. This growth is evident when comparing one of my initial projects in <a href="https://github.com/amarkerr/IT140-Game">IT-140</a>, where I utilized basic console output and a simple Python dictionary, to my project in <a href="https://github.com/amarkerr/CS340-ClientServerDev">CS-340</a>, where I engaged with a NoSQL database and developed a web application that allowed users to search the database effortlessly.
<br/>
<br/>

Security has increasingly influenced my approach to software development. In this project, I substituted insecure login methods with Firebase Fireauth. Reviewing my repository history reveals that my development practices did not always prioritize security. This shifted significantly after taking CS-305. Even in light-hearted personal projects like my <a href="https://github.com/amarkerr/ReplyBot">Discord bot</a>, which posts a GIF when users employ a specific word, my code utilizes a hidden token for secure operation rather than being hardcoded into the script.
<br/>
<br/>

All these skills come together in the project presented here. Rather than submitting multiple artifacts, I concentrated on enhancing a single Android application in three key areas: software design and architecture, algorithms and data handling, and database integration. Each enhancement addresses a fundamental aspect of computer science while improving the app's core features, resulting in a refined final product. This approach allowed me to demonstrate my technical versatility and ability to iteratively improve a project, emphasizing long-term maintainability and user experience.
<br/>
<br/>

Looking forward, I hope to pursue roles that enable me to create tools that prioritize accessibility and usability. This capstone experience has boosted my confidence in my abilities, highlighted the importance of thoughtful design, and enhanced my understanding of how to contribute meaningfully to a development team. I am eager to continue my growth as a developer and apply these skills in a professional environment.

Prior to beginning the project, I conducted a code review for the original Android app. In the following video, I explain how the original code worked, what changes were needed, and how the planned enhancements would improve the application overall.

<center><h2>ðŸ”¹ Enhancements ðŸ”¹</h2></center>
<hr>
In this project, I enhanced three components of the original application to showcase development in vital computer science areas: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Each enhancement reflects a dedicated effort to align the project with industry best practices and illustrates my ability to transform an existing codebase into a more maintainable and user-friendly solution. This project involved shifting the backend from SQLite to Firebase for scalable, cloud-based storage, restructuring it into a modular MVVM pattern, and adding a calendar view to enhance user interaction.
