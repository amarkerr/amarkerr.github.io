## <p align="center">:large_blue_diamond: Intro :large_blue_diamond:</p>
Hi, Iâ€™m Amanda Kerr! As a Computer Science major specializing in software engineering, I am increasingly interested in creating tools that promote accessibility and inclusive design. For my final project at SNHU, I improved a calendar application I had developed earlier in the program to align it more closely with industry standards and contemporary architecture.

This project involved shifting the backend from SQLite to Firebase for scalable, cloud-based storage, restructuring it into a modular MVVM pattern, and adding a calendar view to enhance user interaction. Although the app currently falls short of achieving the complete level of accessibility I strive for in my projects, this process demonstrates my dedication to crafting clean, maintainable code and developing intuitive user experiences that align with that goal.

## <p align="center">:large_blue_diamond: Code Review :large_blue_diamond:</p>
Before starting this project's enhancement phase, I reviewed the original codebase for the calendar application. I walked through the existing features, noted areas where the structure and functionality could be improved, and outlined specific updates in three key areas: software design, algorithm performance, and database integration. I created a video walkthrough of the code review to document this process and share my thought process. In the video, I explain how the original code worked, what changes were needed, and how the planned enhancements would improve the application overall. This review served as the foundation for the technical improvements that followed.

## <p align="center">:large_blue_diamond: Narratives :large_blue_diamond:</p>
In this project, I primarily focused on enhancing three distinct components of a single original project. Both the original project and the three enhancement stages are available in one repository. However, each branch is linked below.

The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/amarkerr/CS499Capstone/tree/original "Original Branch").

The first enhancement focuses on software design and engineering (link to come). In this enhancement...

The second enhancement focuses on algorithms and data structures (link to come). In this enhancement...

The final enhancement focuses on databases (link to come). In this enhancement...
