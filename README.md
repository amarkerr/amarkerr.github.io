# Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

The second enhancement aimed to better organize, filter, and display event data within the application. Previously, events appeared in a flat list, lacking relevance to the current day or context. During the refactor, I introduced logic to dynamically query and present events based on the selected date in the calendar view. This involved reworking how event data flowed through the ViewModel layer and was displayed in the UI. By optimizing the data flow and applying more focused filtering, the app became capable of loading only essential events. These adjustments improved both performance and user experience, showcasing a more systematic approach to data handling in a mobile setting.
