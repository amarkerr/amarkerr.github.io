## ðŸ”¹ Intro ðŸ”¹
Hi, Iâ€™m Amanda Kerr! As a Computer Science major specializing in software engineering, I am increasingly interested in creating tools that promote accessibility and inclusive design. For my final project at SNHU, I improved a calendar application I had developed earlier in the program to align it more closely with industry standards and contemporary architecture.

This project involved shifting the backend from SQLite to Firebase for scalable, cloud-based storage, restructuring it into a modular MVVM pattern, and adding a calendar view to enhance user interaction. Although the app currently falls short of achieving the complete level of accessibility I strive for in my projects, this process demonstrates my dedication to crafting clean, maintainable code and developing intuitive user experiences that align with that goal.

## ðŸ”¹ Code Review ðŸ”¹
Before starting this project's enhancement phase, I reviewed the original codebase for the calendar application. I walked through the existing features, noted areas where the structure and functionality could be improved, and outlined specific updates in three key areas: software design, algorithm performance, and database integration. I created a video walkthrough of the code review to document this process and share my thought process. In the video, I explain how the original code worked, what changes were needed, and how the planned enhancements would improve the application overall. This review served as the foundation for the technical improvements that followed.

## ðŸ”¹ Narratives ðŸ”¹
In this project, I enhanced three key components of the original application to showcase development in vital computer science areas: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Each enhancement reflects a dedicated effort to align the project with industry best practices and illustrates my ability to transform an existing codebase into a more maintainable and user-friendly solution.

The [initial version](https://github.com/amarkerr/CS499Capstone/tree/original "Original Branch") of this project was developed in my CS-360 course and functioned as a simple Android app for event management. Users could register, log in, and create, edit, or delete events displayed as a list on the main screen. The app also included basic SMS reminders to alert users on the day of each scheduled event. While it was functional, the original version offered numerous opportunities to enhance its structure, scalability, and user experience, making it an ideal candidate for upgrades.
